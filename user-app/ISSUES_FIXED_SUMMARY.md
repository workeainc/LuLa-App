# Streamer App Issues Fixed - Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented for the reported issues in the Lula Streamer app.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. All Users Shown Instead of Active Users
**Problem**: The app was displaying all users instead of filtering for active/online users only.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `UserService.js` to filter users by `isOnline: true` status
- Added proper Firestore query filtering for online users
- Enhanced both `getUsers()` and `getOnlineUsers()` methods

**Files Modified**:
- `lula-streamer/services/UserService.js`

### 2. Streamer App Login Issue
**Problem**: Login flow had duplicate dispatch calls and inconsistent navigation logic.

**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate `dispatch(setUser())` calls in login functions
- Fixed navigation logic in `handleRegister` and `handleVerifyOtp`
- Improved error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `lula-streamer/screens/Login.js`

### 3. Re-authentication After Logout/Reinstall
**Problem**: Users were required to go through the entire process again after logout or app reinstall.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced user session persistence with proper AsyncStorage management
- Added `checkUserSession()` method to validate stored user sessions
- Improved user restoration logic in AppNavigation
- Added proper logout handling with `logout()` method
- Better error handling for invalid sessions

**Files Modified**:
- `lula-streamer/services/AuthService.js`
- `lula-streamer/navigations/AppNavigation.js`
- `lula-streamer/screens/Menu.js`

### 4. White Screen on Call Rejection
**Problem**: Users experienced white screens when rejecting incoming calls.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced call rejection handling in `InstantCallUtils.js`
- Added proper navigation fallbacks after call rejection
- Improved cleanup logic in Call screen
- Added navigation to Main screen as fallback

**Files Modified**:
- `lula-streamer/utils/InstantCallUtils.js`
- `lula-streamer/screens/Call.js`

### 5. Portrait Image Upload Issue
**Problem**: Streamers couldn't upload full profile images properly.

**Solution**:
- Enabled image editing/cropping in `ImagePickerHelper.js`
- Added square aspect ratio constraint (1:1) for profile images
- Improved image display with proper `resizeMode: 'cover'`
- Fixed image styling in CreateProfile screen

**Files Modified**:
- `lula-streamer/utils/ImagePickerHelper.js`
- `lula-streamer/screens/CreateProfile.js`

## Technical Improvements

### User Session Management
- Added `isOnline` status tracking
- Implemented `lastLoginAt` and `lastLogoutAt` timestamps
- Better session validation and cleanup

### Error Handling
- Enhanced error handling throughout the app
- Graceful fallbacks for failed operations
- Better user feedback for errors

### Navigation
- Improved navigation flow consistency
- Added fallback navigation to prevent white screens
- Better handling of navigation state

### Data Persistence
- Robust AsyncStorage management
- Proper cleanup on logout/errors
- Session validation before restoration

## Testing Recommendations

1. **User Filtering**: Verify only online users appear in the Users list
2. **Login Flow**: Test login with new and existing users
3. **Session Persistence**: Test app restart and logout/login cycles
4. **Call Handling**: Test call acceptance and rejection scenarios
5. **Image Upload**: Test profile image upload with different image types

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing user activity tracking for better online status
- Add user presence indicators in real-time
- Implement push notifications for user status changes
- Consider adding image compression for better performance

- `services/UserService.js` - User filtering and online status
- `screens/Login.js` - Login flow improvements
- `services/AuthService.js` - Session management and logout
- `navigations/AppNavigation.js` - User restoration logic
